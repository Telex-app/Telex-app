# Telex API

Express backend for the new Telex architecture: WhatsApp conversational payments, direct-custody wallets, payment orchestration, compliance, voice transcription, pricing, queues, and admin monitoring.

## Architecture

The backend routes work through these modules:

```text
src/
  whatsapp/      Conversational assistant
  wallet/        Stellar adapter + WalletService abstraction
  payment/       Payment Orchestrator
  compliance/    KYC tiers, PIN, risk, limits
  voice/         Voice note download + transcription
  pricing/       FX and fee quotes
  queues/        BullMQ queue helpers
  jobs/          Background processors
  common/        Shared audit helpers
```

## Payment Rail

- All payments settle on Stellar.
- Destinations are Stellar `G...` StrKey addresses; users never see rail mechanics — the Payment Orchestrator records everything internally.

## Wallets

`src/wallet/wallet.service.js` is the only backend surface that should talk to the Stellar adapter (`stellar.adapter.js`). Direct custody: the adapter generates a keypair, and the private key is encrypted (AES-256-GCM, `services/crypto.service.js`) before being stored — one `Wallet` row per user.

## Queues

WhatsApp webhooks return `200` immediately, then enqueue work through BullMQ when Redis is configured. In local development without Redis, jobs run through an inline fallback.

## Environment

Use `.env.example`. The main provider keys are:

```text
REDIS_URL=
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
SMILE_ID_PARTNER_ID=
SMILE_ID_API_KEY=
EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=
```

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL (Neon) with Prisma
- `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API
- BullMQ / Redis
- Axios
- Helmet, CORS, Morgan
- PostgreSQL-backed rate limiting (`express-rate-limit` + a custom shared store)
- `node:test` for the test suite

## Run

## OpenAPI Specification (#161)

Telex publishes a machine-readable OpenAPI 3.0 specification at `apps/api/openapi.json`.

- **Spec Endpoint**: `GET /api/docs/openapi.json` (or `GET /api/docs`)
- **CLI Validator**: `node scripts/validate-openapi.js`
- **Test Suite**: `node --test test/openapi.test.js`

To render locally with Swagger UI or Redoc:
```bash
npx @redocly/cli preview-docs openapi.json
```

## API Routes

All JSON responses use a consistent envelope. Every response (header and body)
carries a `correlationId` you can use to match a failure against server logs:

```jsonc
// success
{ "success": true, "message": "…", "correlationId": "…", "data": { /* … */ } }
// error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "…",
  "correlationId": "…",
  "error": {
    "version": "1.0",        // error envelope version — bump = breaking shape change
    "code": "validation_error", // stable machine-readable code — branch on this, never the message
    "message": "…",
    "correlationId": "…",
    "details": { }           // optional, omitted when empty
  }
}
```

The error code catalog is `src/errors/catalog.js`. Core codes and their HTTP
statuses:

| code                | status | meaning                                  |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `validation_error`  | 400    | malformed request / validation failure   |
| `unauthorized`      | 401    | missing or invalid authentication        |
| `forbidden`         | 403    | authenticated but not allowed            |
| `not_found`         | 404    | resource does not exist                  |
| `conflict`          | 409    | duplicate / state conflict (e.g. P2002)  |
| `rate_limited`      | 429    | too many requests                        |
| `provider_error`    | 502    | an upstream provider failed              |
| `service_unavailable`| 503   | temporary unavailability                 |
| `internal_error`    | 500    | unexpected — message is always generic   |

Messages for `internal_error` are never sent verbatim (they can leak secrets or
provider internals); the real error is only logged/reported. Throw
`AppError` (`src/errors/AppError.js`) from controllers/services to carry a
stable code and status, or set `error.statusCode` on a plain `Error` to map by
status.

### Health

```text
GET /health      Liveness/readiness probe (503 if the database link is down)
```

### WhatsApp Webhook

```text
GET  /webhook    Verification handshake (echoes hub.challenge)
POST /webhook    Receives messages — X-Hub-Signature-256 verified first
```

### Admin Routes

```text
POST /api/admin/login          Exchange ADMIN_PASSWORD for a session token
GET  /api/admin/stats          (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/users          (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/wallets        (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/transactions   (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/kyc            (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/audit-logs     (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/admin/system-health  (requires Bearer token)
```

`POST /api/admin/login` takes `{ "password": "…" }` and returns `{ data: { token } }`. Send that token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on the other admin routes. The login endpoint is rate-limited (10 attempts / 15 min) on top of the global limiter.

The list endpoints (`/users`, `/wallets`, `/transactions`) are paginated via `?page` (default 1) and `?limit` (default 50, max 100). `data` is the array of items; a `pagination` block (`{ page, limit, total, totalPages }`) is returned alongside.

### Wallet Routes (optional, for testing without WhatsApp)

```text
POST /api/wallet/create        { phoneNumber }
GET  /api/wallet/:phone/balance
POST /api/wallet/send          { phoneNumber, amount, destination }
```

> ⚠️ These routes are **unauthenticated** — the phone number in the request body is the only identity. They are intended for local testing of the same wallet actions used by WhatsApp. They are **disabled in production by default**; set `ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API=true` to expose them (not recommended without adding per-user auth first). WhatsApp is the real, signature-verified product surface.

### Compliance Self-Service Routes (optional, for testing without WhatsApp)

```text
POST /api/compliance/kyc/start   { phoneNumber, providerReference }
POST /api/compliance/pin         { phoneNumber, pin }
```

> ⚠️ Same story as the wallet routes above — no per-user identity check, gated behind the same `ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API` flag (`middlewares/requireRestApiEnabled`), and disabled in production by default. `GET /api/compliance/kyc/:phone` and `POST /api/compliance/kyc/:id/review` are different: those require an admin Bearer token and are always on.

### Chat Simulator Routes (optional, for testing without WhatsApp)

```text
POST /api/sim/message           { phoneNumber, name?, text }   -> { replies: ["…"] }
GET  /api/sim/messages/:phone?since=<ISO date>                 -> { messages: [{ direction, text, createdAt }] }
```

Runs the same `processMessage` pipeline the WhatsApp webhook uses and returns its replies directly in the response instead of sending them through Meta, so a chat client can drive the bot without a WhatsApp number.

> ⚠️ Same story as the wallet and compliance routes above — no per-user identity check, gated behind `ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API`, and disabled in production by default. The conversation history is currently held in an **in-process memory store** (not persisted, not shared across instances) as a stand-in for the `SimMessage` table + store service tracked in issues #8/#9 — swap it out once those land.

## Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file in `apps/api` using `.env.example` as a guide. The app **fails fast at startup** if the required secrets are missing or weak.

```env
PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/telex

# REST API CORS allowlist (comma-separated). Required in production.
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001

# Required. 64-char hex (32 bytes) for AES-256-GCM wallet-secret encryption.
# Generate: openssl rand -hex 32
ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Required. Admin dashboard auth. ADMIN_PASSWORD is the login password;
# JWT_SECRET (>= 32 chars) signs HMAC session tokens.
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=
ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_HOURS=12

# WhatsApp Business Cloud API
WHATSAPP_TOKEN=your_whatsapp_token_here
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id_here
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
# Required in production. Verifies the X-Hub-Signature-256 header.
WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET=

# Per-user transfer guardrails (XLM)
MAX_SEND_AMOUNT=1000
DAILY_SEND_LIMIT=5000
MAX_SENDS_PER_DAY=50

# Rate limiting (Mongo-backed, shared across instances)
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MIN=15
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
BOT_RATE_WINDOW_SEC=60
BOT_RATE_MAX=20

# Stellar
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

# Optional: expose the unauthenticated REST wallet API (off in prod by default)
ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API=false
```

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a 64-character hexadecimal string because the app uses **AES-256-GCM** (authenticated encryption) for Stellar secret keys. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# or: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Running Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:generate --workspace=apps/api
npm run prisma:deploy --workspace=apps/api
npm run dev --workspace=apps/api
```

For local schema changes during development:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate --workspace=apps/api
```

## Important Gaps

This refactor adds production module boundaries, Prisma/PostgreSQL persistence, and provider adapters, but real-money launch still needs final provider onboarding, contract deployment, worker deployment, automated tests, monitoring, admin RBAC, and compliance approval — including real per-user authentication for the compliance PIN and KYC-start endpoints, which are gated off in production for now (see below).

The backend runs on `http://localhost:3002`.

## Testing

Unit tests (crypto, admin auth, validators) run on the built-in Node test runner — no extra dependencies:

```bash
npm test                         # from apps/api
npm run test --workspace=apps/api  # from the repo root
```

Quick syntax check on a file you changed:

```bash
node --check src/app.js
```

## Testing The REST API

> Requires `ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API=true` (default outside production).

Create a wallet:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/wallet/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber":"+2348000000000"}'
```

Check balance:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/wallet/+2348000000000/balance
```

Send a payment:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/wallet/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber":"+2348000000000","amount":"5","destination":"GDESTINATIONSTELLARADDRESS"}'
```

## Testing WhatsApp Webhooks Locally

1. Start the backend on port `3002`.
2. Expose the backend with `ngrok` or `localtunnel`.
3. Configure the WhatsApp Business webhook URL as `https://your-public-url/webhook`.
4. Set the same verify token in WhatsApp and `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`.
5. Set `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` to your Meta app secret so POST signatures verify (in development, an unset secret is allowed with a warning; in production unsigned POSTs are rejected).
6. Send a WhatsApp message to the configured business number.

## Security Posture

Already in place:

- Real admin authentication with HMAC-signed, expiring session tokens; the API refuses to start without `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET`.
- Admin API routes protected by the `requireAdmin` middleware; login endpoint rate-limited.
- WhatsApp webhook POSTs verified against `X-Hub-Signature-256` (fail-closed in production).
- Inbound message idempotency to prevent duplicate transfers from webhook retries.
- KYC tiers with daily/single-transaction limits and risk scoring, enforced on every payment via the Payment Orchestrator.
- CORS allowlist enforced in production; PostgreSQL-backed shared rate limiting.
- The unauthenticated REST wallet API, and the equally unauthenticated `POST /api/compliance/pin` / `POST /api/compliance/kyc/start`, are all disabled in production by default (`ENABLE_WALLET_REST_API`).

## Security and Production Requirements

Before a real-money launch, this backend still needs:

- Real per-user authentication for `POST /api/compliance/pin` and `POST /api/compliance/kyc/start` — they currently accept any phone number with no identity check, so they're kept behind the production flag rather than actually fixed; no user can self-serve a PIN or start KYC in production until this is built.
- Managed secret/key management (KMS/HSM) for provider credentials, with key rotation.
- Audit-log coverage for all sensitive admin and compliance actions, plus monitoring and alerting.
- Replacement of the single shared admin password with real admin accounts and roles.
- Broader automated test coverage (payment orchestrator, wallet, webhook, voice, and compliance flows).
- Legal, compliance, KYC, AML, and custody review where required.

## Current Limitations

- Simple WhatsApp command/intent parsing (regex-based).
- Single shared admin password (no per-admin accounts or roles yet).
- REST wallet API, compliance PIN, and KYC-start endpoints are unauthenticated by design and disabled in production by default (see above) — no working production path until real per-user auth exists.
- No customer web login/signup — WhatsApp phone number is the identity.
- Stellar corridor execution is stubbed pending provider/custody onboarding.

## Testing without WhatsApp

You can test the conversational assistant locally without a WhatsApp number by using the built-in chat simulator.

### 1. Configure the environment

Set the following environment variables in `apps/api/.env`:

```env
MESSAGE_TRANSPORT=sim
ENABLE_CHAT_SIM=true
```

- `MESSAGE_TRANSPORT=sim` stores outbound bot messages in the simulator instead of sending them to the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- `ENABLE_CHAT_SIM=true` enables the simulator endpoints.

### 2. Start the API

```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:generate --workspace=apps/api
npm run prisma:deploy --workspace=apps/api
npm run dev --workspace=apps/api
```

### 3. Send a message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/sim/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumber":"+2348000000001",
    "name":"Ada",
    "text":"balance"
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "replies": ["Your Telex balances: ..."]
}
```

### 4. Fetch the conversation

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/sim/messages/+2348000000001
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "direction": "in",
      "text": "balance",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "direction": "out",
      "text": "Your Telex balances: ...",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:01.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Telegram transport

Telex can run its bot on Telegram instead of WhatsApp. Set
`MESSAGE_TRANSPORT=telegram` and the same conversation, payment and voice
pipeline serves Telegram chats; `meta` continues to work unchanged, so the two
can be switched between without a migration.

### Identity

Telegram addresses people by a numeric `chat_id` and never volunteers a phone
number, but everything in Telex — wallets, recipient resolution, pending
claims, KYC — is keyed on an E.164 phone number. Onboarding therefore opens with
a **Share phone number** keyboard button, and Telegram returns a verified number
in a `contact` object. That pair is stored in `TelegramLink`, the single place
the two namespaces meet.

A link is only written when `contact.user_id` matches the sender, so a forwarded
third-party contact card cannot bind someone else's number to your chat. Until a
chat is linked, no message from it is enqueued.

### Setup

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (32+ random characters)
   and `TELEGRAM_CALLBACK_URL` (must be HTTPS and end in `/webhook/telegram`).
3. Register the webhook:

   ```bash
   node scripts/configure-telegram-webhook.js
   ```

   `--info` prints the current registration and Telegram's last delivery error;
   `--delete` unregisters it.

### How it differs from the Meta transport

| | Meta | Telegram |
|---|---|---|
| Authenticity | `X-Hub-Signature-256`, an HMAC over the body | `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`, a static shared secret |
| Delivery receipts | sent / delivered / read callbacks | none — `sent` is terminal |
| Proactive messages | blocked after 24h without an approved template | always allowed |
| Voice media | Graph API media URL | `getFile` then the file host |

The secret token is a bearer credential rather than a body signature: anyone who
observes one request can replay forged updates. The webhook therefore refuses
plaintext transport in production, and the token supports comma-separated values
so it can be rotated the same way `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` is.

Because Telegram sends no delivery callbacks, `WhatsappStatusEvent` and the
delivery-status pipeline stay idle on this transport — a Telegram notification
settles at `sent` and never advances to `delivered` or `read`.
