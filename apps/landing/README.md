# Telex Landing Site

The Telex landing site is a Vite + React marketing page that introduces the product — WhatsApp-first payments on the Stellar network — and links visitors to the admin dashboard.

Part of the [Telex](../../README.md) monorepo.

## Pages

```text
/                 Landing page
```

## Environment Variables

Create `apps/landing/.env`:

```env
VITE_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Develop

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:landing   # http://localhost:3000
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build --workspace=apps/landing
```

## Test

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run test:landing
```

Runs component/smoke tests (navigation, CTAs, FAQ) and `jest-axe` accessibility
checks against the rendered home page with Vitest + Testing Library, in jsdom.
No live services or network access required. CI runs this on every PR via the
`landing-tests` job in [`test.yml`](../../.github/workflows/test.yml).
